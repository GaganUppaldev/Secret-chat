I have spotted major issue with logic of the web app so now it will take time to correct logic than code it agian 
#using a new approch to manage and get chats in clint side.

Now main chat portion is working :
*users can sign up and create account
*users can login
*users can add people to contacts
*users can chat with contacts properly

Next features that i will now work to add:
*providing info who sent message to whom in client side 
*Using websockets for fast chating

I have spotted major issue with logic of the web app so now it will take time to correct logic than code it agian 
#using a new approch to manage and get chats in clint side.

Now main chat portion is working :

*users can sign up and create account
*users can login
*users can add people to contacts
*users can chat with contacts properly
*providing info who sent message to whom in client side 

*websockets are working as follow : 
When user login and than goes to contact section than websockets connection establish between client
and server , after it user goes to database which is for active user.
when user leave chat page than websockets connection disconnect and at same got deleted from database

#Now user will click on send button but after click now a post req will go to api endpoint to find if recevier
is active on chat section or not so if res is 402 means not found in Active user database than Restful API will send detials
and add messages to database . 

now just small part of code is left to send message through websockets to database , till now we can only 
see in terminal 

#Reason of delay ?
A little bit of task is left but the reason is that i am working on my own website link is give below .
